//  Many things are done incorrectly in this code base but I have not taken the
//  time to revise them for the open source release. There are also many compile
//  time warnings which should be corrected as some of them hint at serious problems.
//  If you work for a company looking to hire me, don't look too critically at this old code!
//  Similarly, if you're trying to learn Cocoa / Objective-C, keep this in mind.
