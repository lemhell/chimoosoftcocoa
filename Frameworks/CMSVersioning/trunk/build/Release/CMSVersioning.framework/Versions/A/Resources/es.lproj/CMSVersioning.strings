/* Note that the %@ will be replaced automatically.  If the localized language
requires different ordering of these terms, feel free to move the %@ in the localized version. 

If you need to reorder parameters inside the translated string, use the special n$ tags (where n specifies 
the position of the original argument) in between the formatting characters. The following example 
shows a string whose two arguments are reversed in the translated string: 

"%@ Error! %@ failed!" = "%2$@ blah blah, %1$@ blah!";
